#### notes
* Comments list's inner scrollbars could be styled with custom library to match the graphical design on every browser. Those libraries are not lightweight, so it would make sense if they were used throughout the website, not only in one component.

* Infinity loading could be implemented for comments list.

* Icons by fontawesome.com

* Font weight was set to 500 despite 400 given in design files. It was done so that it looks most similar to graphical design. Font weight 400 of Montserrat font in browser looks much lighter then on design. (Most probably due to different anti-aliasing techniques)
